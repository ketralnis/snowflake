specialsnowflake is a tool for quickly categorising URLs

For instance, you may want to be able to use a group of 10 people to quickly
filter a list of thousands of URLs as spam, or a list of images as pornographic

# usage

The easiest way to start it is to install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
and do:

    vagrant up

Then connect to http://localhost.localdomain:8080

If `samples.txt` and `labels.txt` exist they will be imported after creating the
server. `samples.txt` is a newline-separated list of URLs to rate and
`labels.txt` is a newline-separated list of labels to assign to them
